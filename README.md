## 2. Application Description ðŸªª

The purpose of the application is to download API data from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/ "OpenWeatherMap") server. The API service runs under a free license and guarantees access to weather forecasts every 3 hours.

The user can search for weather through the search button. The displayed weather shows predictions for the next few dozen hours in a given location. The application comes with a user-friendly interface with pictures.
